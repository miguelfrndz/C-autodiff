# Auto-Differentiation Engine in C
Basic implementation of a simple auto-differentiation engine in C. Includes forward-mode (using the `dual` type) and reverse-mode (using the `Var` type).

## TODO: Pending Tasks
* Implement a parser to generate the expression graph based on any function definition (to overcome lack of operator overloading in C).
* Make a Python interface to deploy the library.
